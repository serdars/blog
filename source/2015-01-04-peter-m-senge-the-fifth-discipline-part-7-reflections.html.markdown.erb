Now that we have an understanding of the five disciplines and their interactions, it is time to look at some implementations of these in big organizations in the world.

## Foundations

All of the examples we will see below originate from the idea of "growing organizations through growing people" and "creating more reflective work environments where dialogue and inquiring into taken-for-granted mental models are possible".

At BP in order to foster greater cooperation across organizational boundaries, leaders have some ideas but instead of discussing them directly they set up workshops with a diverse set of people across the organization. The ideas they reached were more complex and strong than their original ideas. They also had automatic buy-in since they were created by people across the organization.

### Reflective Openness

Two different types of openness should be explained: participative (or expressive) and reflective openness. First one is composed of speaking openly about one's views. This is dangerously incomplete for learning organizations. Things like surveys, focus groups are not really effective when people do not reflect into their own work or behavior. They do not surface the kinds of deep and potentially threatening or embarrassing information that motivates true learning and real change. Reflective openness includes looking internally and being open about our internal selves.

Reflective openness is scary for most of the people especially high level managers with traditional view. It is very unlikely to happen in an organization which does not have a deep commitment of helping people grow.

"You have to believe in your heart that people want to pursue a vision that matters, that they want to contribute and be responsible for results and that they are willing to look at shortfalls in their own behavior and correct problems whenever they are able." - Rich Teerlink former CEO of Harley Davidson.

Roca is an organization in Massachusetts. They have applied the dialogue techniques to a low-income community to create a safe and healthy community for young people. In order to be successful gradually they started including people from education system, law enforcement and families over time in their dialogues. They have helped each party to understand the other through dialogue. They core method was based on "showing up for one another" in "peacekeeping circles".

Without individuals reflecting on themselves learning is not possible. So any leadership in learning must start with leaders committing to personal mastery themselves.

### Organizations as Living Systems

There are two distinct intellectual traditions behind the systems thinking discipline. 1-) Engineering Theory which tries to understand systems with tools and computer simulations 2-) Increasing the understanding of living systems to make sense of other complex interdependent systems.

Seeing a business as a living system requires us to see it as a human community. Machine image (a machine for making money) is far more common in the modern world. All terminology is based on machine thinking: There are "owners" of the company. Leaders try to "drive change". But we know what happens when we try to "drive" our spouse or our children.

VISA for e.g. does not operate as other companies. It has no publicly traded stock. It is owned by 20k member organizations. It has no large headquarters. It is a network governed by members with a written constitution that spells out the purpose and operating principles. Its founder CEO terms this style of organizing "chaordic" because in nature "order continually emerges from seeming chaos while in management we always try to impose order because we fear that chaos will take over".

Biologist Gregory Bateson says "the source of all problems today comes from the gap between how we think and how actually nature works". Take DNA for example. "We know that in healthy living systems like the human body or wetlands the control is distributed. But the Newtonian inside us puts us into a 'someone must be in control' mindset."

## Impetus (the force or energy with which a body moves)

Building learning oriented cultures is hard work in any setting. First and foremost it requires ourselves to step our comfort zone and stress ourselves by practicing reflective openness. On top of this it has many chances of failing due to the common obstacles any revolutionary change can. Overall there seems to be three overlapping but distinct motivation for building a learning oriented culture:

* Seeking a better model for how to manage and lead change.
* Trying to build an adaptive organization.
* Improve performance, productivity and create types of workplaces people would truly like to work.

In none of the instances of evolving to a learning oriented culture, change comes after all the parties understand and acknowledge the principles of systems thinking, personal mastery, etc... Change always comes by increased reflection, dialogue and distribution of autonomy. This can be achieved by AARs (After Action Reviews or Postmortems), diverse working groups, stating principles rather than prescriptive instructions.

## Strategies

So how does one strategize in order to get closer to an organization with a learning focus:
