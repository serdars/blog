Part 1 of the magnum opus of [Daniel Kahneman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman), [Thinking Fast & Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1417992744) talks about how the mind works. These are my notes from this section.

### Introduction

* Our judgement & decision making is hugely impacted by the biases that we are not consciously aware of.
* (Cue -> Access to Memory -> Answer) a.k.a. Intuition.
* We are most of the time overconfident about the things we believe we know and most of the time unable to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in.
* Hindsight bias positive feedback loop + “I” centric view that we’ve adopted during rationalism.

### The Characters of the Story

* Our minds are composed of two systems. System 1 & System 2.
* System 1 operates automatically quickly without voluntary control.
* System 2 is the voice in our heads the one that we believe we are. Requires attention.
* Question: What is the difference between attention and consciousness?
* Invisible Gorilla study
* System 1 and System 2 continiously conflict. Optical illusions are the most basic examples.
* System 2 needs to put in effort to not let System 2 go ahead and execute a potentially less advantageous choice.
* Best we can do in these situations is to recognize the conflict and spend effort as necessary based on the stakes.
* A sentence is understood more easily if it describes what an agent (System 2) does than if it describes what something is, what properties it has.

**Note:** Kahneman creates 2 characters for System 1 and System 2. We should note this analogy applies to System 2 better than System 1 since System 2 is already a voice in our heads but System 1 is composed of many voices in our heads. The way I think about System 1 is being composed of many people who are shouting whatever they recognize as loud as they can to another person who continuously listens to these and selects some of them based on a criteria that he knows and raises them to System 2. System 2’s input the System 1, is not direct. If System 2 does something enough times, System 1 changes its behavior. It adopts the things System 2 does. It tries to make System 2’s job easier. We should note that this is all an analogy :)

### Attention and Effort

* In order for System 2 to work, it needs to spend energy. System 1 doesn’t do certain tasks by default like basic math. We use “mental effort” to make it work. As with other energies it has a maximum and total amount of energy it can spend.
* Getting skilled in a task reduces the amount of mental effort required to do it.
* System 2 can program System 1 on a temporary basis. Like count the number of words in this page. You will start with 1, 2, 3 and start building up strategies where you bump up the number every time you see a space and slowly bump it up so that System 2 throws you something when it passes over 5 spaces, etc…
* See Speed Reading classes.
* Humans operate under the law of least effort. They think as little as possible.
* This is due to the sheer amount of information mind gets.

### The Lazy Controller

* Every task requires a certain amount of attention. Even walking. If you think hard enough you will walk to places you never know without recollecting how you end up there.
* If you try to modify your walking stride, you will not be able to think clearly anymore.
* Ideal condition is “flow” where System 2 effortlessly spends effort and one likes it.
* System 2 can be depleted. It can’t get things done when it is.
* Remember the Willpower book. Ego depletion makes self control tough when faced with a challenge. Similar to willpower, System 2 has a muscle one needs to build.
* Glucose boosts System 2 quickly and temporarily.
* "Intelligence is not only the ability to reason. It is also the ability to find the relevant material in memory and deploy attention when needed.”
* By default, people operate in “Intellectual Sloth” mode. Total opposite of Chomsky’s recommendation “Intellectual Self Defense”.
* Intelligent vs Rational (or Engaged): Intelligence raw horse power. Rational (Engaged) is the controller that drives the raw power to reach to a destination.

### Associative Machine

* System 1 works by association. When it sees the word “vomit” it recalls bad memories, makes you feel a little bit disgusted.
* System 2 is generally not aware of what happens in System 1 unless you are doing a lot of meditation :)
* The fact that you can still read a sentence even tough each word is missing a letter.
* Priming: When we see words that are related to “oldness” we move slowly. When we see words related to money, our greediness (related to that individualism) is primed.

### Cognitive Ease

* Ease is the state we’re in when we feel good, doing things effortless. Maybe caused by repeated experience (familiarity), priming, good mood, clear display (?)
* Illusion of Remembering: “The experience of familiarity has a simple but powerful quality of ‘pastness’ that seems to indicate that it is a direct reflection of prior experience.”
* We generally confuse familiarity with remembering.
* Illusion of Truth: “When you say something 40 times it becomes a truth.” - Turkish saying
* We generally confuse repetition therefore familiarity with truth.
* If you need to make something more believable:
* Reduce the cognitive strain (make it easy to read / understand)
* Use simpler words
* Put your ideas in verse if you can
* Quote people with names that are easy to pronounce
* Cognitive strain mobilizes System 2 which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1.
* When we are uncomfortable and unhappy our System 1 is affected. We lose touch with out intuition.
* This maybe related to worry / aversion where they have a priority in System 1 before creativity or solving miscellaneous problems.

### Norms, Surprise and Causes

* System 1 maintains and updates a model about your personal life and what’s normal in it.
* Surprise is a great indication of what are our expectancies and how we model life.
* Repetition decreases the impact of surprises.
* System 1 models the world and sets theories on normal by constantly making causality chains.
* This reflects in us as a constant search for causalities in between events.
* In fact all the headlines do is to satisfy our need for coherence. In reality large events have many consequences and many consequences require many causes.
* And there is also intention. Intention is always mixed up with causality. When you’re picking up something with your hand you experience it as if the decision an inner you gave caused you to pick up the thing with your hand. “Paul Bloom in Atlantic 2005 made a provocative claim that our inborn readiness to separate physical and intentional causality explains the near universality of religious beliefs. Since we perceive the world of objects as essentially separate from the world of minds, we can envision soulless bodies and bodiless souls. Two different modes of causation make us natural to accept a divinity as the cause of physical world. Two concepts of causality are shaped by evolution building the origins of religion into System 1."

**Note:** This is very inline with meditative texts. It is argued that if you look closely you can witness the momentary difference between the time intention forms in the brain due to many causes and the time your hand picks up the thing. However connecting this to the causality of physical world is a little bit overkill. Near universality of religious beliefs can be explained by the new universality of the nature of the human needs and resources available to them at the given time. I don’t think people believe because their System 1 is imprinted. They believe because it is much easier, explains a lot of the questions, removes fear, etc… The intention causality is a by product of our self concept.

* Heider made an experiment by moving a triangle and square next to each other up over a diagonal line. When he added two eyes to the triangle, participants explained the situation as “triangle is chasing the square over the hill”. Eyes triggered System 1 to find a causality.

### A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions

* System 1 automatically connects the dots in between the information it receives and jumps to conclusions and throws these away to System 2. System 2, unless it spends time, doesn’t think about the assumptions there and accepts the conclusions it is given and usually doesn’t even detect that they came from a System 1 after an automated process.
* This is great in the world we live in because many of the decisions we need to take can be handled with a way like this. It is cost effective and efficient unless the times where it fails are does not have too high cost.
* System 1 is ready to believe and get a conclusion. This results in a confirmation bias. Different things will come into your mind if you’re asked “Is Sam friendly?” or “Is Sam unfriendly?”
* Halo Effect: The tendency to like / dislike everything (even the things you didn’t see) about a person / thing.
* Consequence of Halo Effect: Initial impressions effect later impressions of a thing / person.
* Reading exam papers question by question rather than student by student. How does the grades change?
* Success of System 1 is based on the coherence of the story it generates, not the amount and quality of the data it is based on.
* She is intelligent, strong, corrupt and cruel vs She is corrupt, cruel, intelligent and strong.
* Framing: Different ways of presenting the same information generates different emotions
* System 1 focus on the existing evidence and ignores the absent evidence

### How Judgements Happen

* System 1 continuously monitors the environment and makes assessments. (gut feelings when we see a person)
* Primarily shaped by the evolution so assessments are about survival / food / etc...
* System 1 can calculate averages very easily but doesn’t do so well on the sums.
* Because it can do comparisons easily.
* System 1 can do intensity matching. It can assign a shade of red to a specific crime denoting its intensity.
* System 1 casts a wide net in its monitoring and generates a range of ideas rather than a focused few.

### Answering an Easier Question

* In order to be able to move fast, we replace a hard question with a basic (heuristic) question and answer the basic question.
* Without self-awareness, we don’t realize this.
* Heuristic Replacement is a by product of mental shotgun and intensity matching, needs to be detected by System 2 and reversed in case stakes are high.
* Happiness Mood Heuristic (recent happenings determine long term happiness) / Affect Heuristic (likes / dislikes determine other things)
