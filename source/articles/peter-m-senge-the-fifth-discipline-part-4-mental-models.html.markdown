## Mental Models

Most of the great ideas & novel ways of doing things fail when they face with reality. This is because we have a deeply embedded understanding of how things work and we subconsciously discard any idea conflicting with them even tough there is no good rational reason against these ideas. This is why being mindful about our mental models is fundamental to learning.

None of us can carry an organization in our minds, or a family or a project. We carry images and assumptions around things. We carry mental models. They can be simple generalizations such as "People are not trustworthy" or they can be complex theories about why the people interact with each other as they do. If we believe that our friend lacks self-confidence, we have the tendency to see this in our friend's behavior and continually intervene with this belief.

The reason they are so powerful is because they affect what we see. Two people with different mental models walking into a party sees different things. As Einstein reminded us, **"Our theories determine what we measure".** When executives from US car manufacturers went into Japan to understand why they were losing market share, they came back with the belief that they were not shown the real manufacturing plants because there was no inventory on site. Their mental models prevented them to see the fact that Japanese were operating with a different system.

**The problem with the mental models doesn't lie in the fact that they are right or wrong - by definition all models are simplifications.** The problem is that, they operate in our subconscious. When they are wrong and unexamined, the gap between them and the reality widens overtime resulting in increasingly counter-productive actions.

They are especially problematic in organizations. When multiple people share a mental model, it is harder to change because it is not enough if one person detects it and changes his thinking. Another complicating factor is that people has a habit to display different behavior without changing their beliefs. This habit is installed by old school hierarchical leadership. There are countless examples of adopting a new idea and seeing benefit of it but not sticking with it overtime because of the embedded mental models.

## Changing Mental Models in Organizations

Book contains an example of how Shell and BP has changed their understanding of the world and their approach to business by changing their mental models. One of them embedded the practice into strategic planning by games with the aim to influence the mental images of decision makers and the other distributed the decision making and business accountability to local divisions by developing networks. There are countless number of ways to surface mental models. The correct way depends on the nature of the organization, but it is not writing a document.

Promoting personal awareness and reflective skills and providing infrastructure for regular practice is the common element. Saying "We value openness" doesn't mean people are promoting openness. Everyone talks about creating a culture and improving a culture. But practice goes beyond the words (and also takes time).

Most of the people in the world are far far away from being able to have open & productive discussions with each other. This is a normality. Thankfully there are tools to practice in order to makes this job easier.

Theory and method for examining the reasoning in our actions is called **action science**. There are many tools developed by its practitioners. The most common and effective one is **Reflection in Action** which involves recalling a conflict, recalling what was said as well as what were we thinking at that moment of time.

There are more than one way of looking at complex issues. For e.g. eastern and western approach to management. None of them are wrong and the fact of right and wrong does not matter. Understanding the fact that what we subconsciously see as **truths** are just **assumptions** makes us analyze them and decrease the gap between them and reality when needed.

## Tools and Skills

Two broad categories of skills core to the discipline of mental models are: **Reflective** and **Inquiry** skills. Where we want to get to in this discipline is:

* Facing up to distinctions between **Espoused Theories vs Theories-In-Use**.
* Recognizing **Leaps of Abstraction**.
* Exposing the **Left Hand Column**.
* **Balancing Inquiry & Advocacy**.

### Reflective Practice

In order to become **generative** learners, life long learners at one point need to become **reflective practitioners** to overcome their own shortcomings. They constantly reflect on themselves to surface their mental models and put them under scrutiny. When good musicians improvise together, they constantly check themselves and their group to understand where they are going individually and going as a group.

### Espoused Theory vs Theory-In-Use

When we face our mental models and realize the differences between them and the current reality, we might face discouragement, hypocrisy even cynicism. This is due to our habitual understanding of failure. When we realize the difference and acknowledge it we have a chance to learn.

The first question to pose is "Do I really value the espoused theory?" or "Is it really part of my vision?". If there is no commitment to the espoused theory, then the gap is not between my vision and reality (no tension) but it is between reality and a view I advance (maybe because of how it will make me look to others).

**An ruthlessly compassionate partner** is our best friend to surface our mental models and put them under scrutiny. As the old saying goes **The eye can not see the eye.**

### Leaps of Abstraction

When our minds are flying at the speed of light in a busy day we constantly make **leaps of abstraction** such as "Laura doesn't care about people". They happen when we move from direct observation to generalization without testing. It is important to be able to detect these since they might not be correct. But we shouldn't be doing this detection constantly because it will overheat our brains. When we look into the observation with compassion we can understand the causes and see if our leap is correct.

These leaps are not always around the common real life happenings. Another example is "Customers buy our product based on price, quality of customer service is not a factor". These are especially hard to detect and more dangerous.

The steps to detect leaps of abstraction:

1. What is my belief about the way world works?
1. What is the 'data' on with this belief is based?
1. Am I willing to consider this generalization may be inaccurate or misleading?
1. (If the answer is no, there is no point in proceeding)
1. TODO: Separate the belief from data and test directly when possible.

### Left-Hand Column

This is a technique to see how our mental models operate in particular situations. It is about capturing the behind the scenes thoughts that occur during a conversation:

```
What I'm Thinking     What is Said
-----------------     ------------
```

### Balancing Inquiry & Advocacy

Most managers are trained to be advocates. But when we encounter issues that are more complex and diverse from our personal experience we need to tap into insights from other people. This is done by inquiry.

When two advocates face each other, they usually advocate their own views even when they have the best intentions to have an open candid conversation. As they reasonable and calmly argue for their points, their positions become more and more rigid. In fact there is a systems archetype for this situation: **Escalation**.

The leverage to break the Escalation loop is to ask inquiry questions. But pure inquiry is also limited. We almost always have a view regardless of the fact that whether we believe or not this it is correct. Pure inquiry blocks learning by hiding our view behind infinite number of questions.

The right move is to combine inquiry and advocacy, **reciprocal inquiry**. In this mode the goal is not to win the argument but to find the best argument. The simple change in the communication is to word one's view as "Here is my view and here is how I arrived at it. What do you think?" Putting things into checklist form:

* Make your reasoning explicit.
* Encourage others to explore your view.
* Encourage others to provide different views.
* Inquire into other's views.
  * State your assumptions about the other's views if any.
  * State the data on which the assumptions are based.
  * Don't inquire if you are not genuinely interested in other's response.
* When at impasse:
  * Ask what data or logic can change the other's view.
  * Ask if we can create an experiment together that might provide more information.
  * Ask what might be making talking openly about this subject difficult.

### Does agreement matter?

Most of the time, mental models around a complicated situation might not agree. And this is OK. The important bit is to surface the mental models and put them under scrutiny in a safe environment. Agreement might not surface. But if the parties are all committed to truth, they will still progress decreasing the gap between mental models and current reality.

## Mental Models and Fifth Discipline

Without surfacing the gap between our automatical mental models and the reality, progressing towards our personal vision will be slower if not blocked. Creating an environment where doing so is safe will provide the practice infrastructure to break hierarchical decision making and increase the autonomy and involvement of the participants.

You can detect progress when people stop talking like "Things are this way" and start talking like "The way I see it, things are this way".
