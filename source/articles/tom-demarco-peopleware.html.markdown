### Team Sociology

Majority of the problems that stand between a project and success are generally not technical problems but sociological ones. **Politics** is not the right word when talking about these problems. This word is used when we don't want to engage with some problems. We classify them as institutional, un-fixable and classify them under **Politics** to excuse ourselves from attempting to solve them.

### Theory of Values

There have been two theories of value historically. Spanish Theory of Value stated that there is a fixed amount of value on the Earth so the way to extract more value is to try to be more efficient when using resources. English Theory of Value stated that additional value can be obtained by ingenuity and technology. Spain ended up going around the world to try to extract more value from land. English went through the industrial revolution.

### Efficiency & Productivity

We are most efficient & productive when we are in **flow**. This is the state where we are spending effort effortlessly, not aware of the time and our surroundings and focusing on one thing only without any interruptions.

The traditional methods to boost efficiency & productivity (like overtime, long hours, etc...) are only useful for a short amount of time. They are like sprinting. If we are sprinting all the time, we will get tired. We will not be working better we will only be working faster.

It is important to try to maximize the uninterrupted hours in order to boost productivity. (See email and meetings section as well.)

### Deadlines / Pressure

Parkinson's Law: Some British dude Parkinson theorized that work expands the time allocated for it.

Thankfully Parkinson's Law and the Spanish Value Theory is not attempted in most of the organizations nowadays. Phony deadlines are still used as a mutated form of the Parkinson's law.

When all the team knows that a deadline is phony, there is no reason for a manager to stick with it other than insecurity and neediness. Rather than attempting to create pressure (which decreases the productivity), a manager should be able to create a common sense of a goal for team to align at (which increases productivity).

### Quality

All the builders take pride in the work we do. We would like our work to shine and get used by many people. No one wants to build a low quality piece of software and watch people use it. We have internal quality requirements for the software we are building. This level is both rational and emotional. We set ourselves for the future by ensuring we have strong enough technical roots from which our tree can grow. We also form a connection between the quality of the thing we're building and our abilities as a builder. The lower the quality, the worse our perception will be.

Swimming against this natural flow of quality, most of the times due to pressure to ship, is counter-productive. Not only because it sets the team up to spend more time supporting & maintaining a low quality product but also it de-motivates the team since team now views itself as a low quality team.

### Corporate Entropy

Entropy is the level of sameness. In corporations similar to the universe, entropy always increases. The higher the entropy, the lower the chances of great energy and creative work.

### Office Environment

There are many factors in an office environment that might impact a team. Not surprisingly, curiosity of many failed to find a direct link between any aspect of an environment and productivity. But there are a few things to keep in mind when thinking about the physical environment:

* Privacy: **Flow** is only possible in silent spots with minimized distractions and with privacy.
* Having people working together close is preferred since it helps them build relationships.
* Entropy in a physical environment is a subconscious sign of entropy in the culture of the company. It should be watched out.
* Every one works better in an environment that they can tailor to their specific needs. When teams are doing this, it is a great sign of developing team identity.

(As always) Christopher Alexander's Organic Order Theory provides some patterns to be included in an environment for different needs of teams:

* Tailored workspace from a kit.
* Windows
* Public Space
* Teams can find more for themselves if they think.

Environment is always in evolution. The thing to watch out for is the signs of distress in it. E.g. people reserving conference room in order to hide and work, listening music with speaker phones to control white noise and interruptive noise, etc... These can be signs of limitations in the environment or in a bigger scope.

### People

The high level strategy recommended can be summarized as:

* Get the right people.
* Make them happy so they don't leave
* Turn them loose.

Rather than connectionless aptitude tests, technical questions with yes no answers, and out of the box packages; it is important to try to measure the connection between the candidate and the team. If a team is forming an identity, ensuring this identity is coherent when hiring is important. Also hiring is a great tool to decrease the entropy of teams when needed.

From accounting point of view it is different to give $100 to utilities and to buy a server. Server is part of infrastructure so it is not a direct expense. Similar way of thinking should be applied to human capital. Investing in a conference or training is not necessarily a direct expense.

When people leave, or company downsizes, there are hidden costs in the system for teams. Assuming a replacement is found immediately, obvious one is the ramp up time for the new comer as well as extra time needed from the members to mentor the new comer. Less obvious one is the risk to team relationships and recovery of the normalness.

Watching the turnover rate is a must for every manager. Great teams have low turn over rates. People behave as if they are not expected to leave. In normal teams people leave because:

1. No long term involvement and no reason for long term involvement with the job.
2. Feeling of disposability.
3. Seeing loyalty as reasonless.

### Jelled Team

Jelled Team is a highly functioning team. They have a sense of identity. Individuals have goals and these are aligned with the team's goals. Members have a sense of eliteness and when doing their jobs they enjoy themselves. A great example is Black Team @ IBM. Sense of eliteness may lead to turning the team into a clique. This is something to be watched for.

The job of the manager is not to lead the team. It is to remove the blocks in the team's road and prepare the rest of the teams for this team's momentum. The things a manager can do to kill these types of teams are:

* Defensive Management: When manager doesn't trust his team members, he is in trouble. Without autonomy jelled teams are unachievable.
* Bureaucracy: Unnecessary process, documentation will slow a team down and decrease the motivation of individual members.
* Physical Separation:
* Time Fragmentation: Flow breaker, productivity killer and demoralizer due to decreased amount of perceived progress. The biggest sin of all.
* Quality:
* Phony Deadlines:
* Clique Control: Breaking up a team during their momentum building stage.

Coaching and leadership in jelled teams are not done by a single person. Since members complete each other, they also coach each other in the areas that they are strong at.

Competition is tricky. It can be good or bad based on the situation. One of the possible things that can kill a team is the performance ratings though. Any action that rewards team members differentially is likely to foster adversary competition.

One can't put together jelled team all the time but they can increase the chances of a team getting jelled up. A few things one can do are:

* Trusting team members.
* Sensible subordination: Knowing when to break the rules.
* Augmenting / protecting team identity & feeling of eliteness
* Natural authority: Manager doesn't invoke the power given to her from the upper levels.
* Providing satisfying closure: As human being we all need some reassurance that we're headed in the right direction.
* Structured as a network, not a hierarchy: There is no permanent leader. Depending on the situation each person leads at different times.

### Leadership

A manager invites her team to her place for a dinner. When people show up they drink a couple of beers and chat. Manager admits that she didn't have time to prep a dinner and says that we should be talented enough to put together a spaghetti dinner. Without any further directions and one fellow starts on the salad and the other is putting together a sauce. The new comer offers his signature garlic bread. Manager chimes in when someone needs the onions cut. They eat until they are full and get started on the cleaning.

Manager's effort is invisible. It all seems natural. Good managers provide opportunities for teams to succeed together (periodic demos are an example of this kind) and build momentum. They have a subconscious understanding / feeling of what's good for the team.

### Risk

All the great things that can be done with low risk is already done. One needs to question what he is doing if there is no risk involved. One risk that we do never manage is our own failure. This is not fun since working in case you fail is demotivating. This should only be done when the consequences of our failure is so dire that they can not be contained.

### Meetings

We are all aware of the potential meeting hell we can fall into anytime. One of the tricks to see if a meeting is a working meeting or non-working meeting is to check if "What needs to happen for this meeting to end?" question can be answered. Some examples of non-working meeting are:

* Ceremonies: Mostly due to defensive management, where manager talks with each member one by one and forces the others to listen. Mostly to assert the manager-ness.
* Laptop Meetings: Where everyone works on the laptops.
* Visibility Meetings: In order for people to increase their visibility across the organization.

### Corporate Spam and Silent Consent

Similar to unnecessary meetings, our email is also filled with unnecessary emails. Most of the reasons why we have so many are similar with the reasons we have many meetings.

An important note for emails is the "silent consent". The default rule in corporations is that if you're included in an email chain and if you don't raise your voice, you specify your consent. This results in defensive emailing in order to make sure that you don't give your consent to things that you don't want to.

Also the missing trust between the manager and the team members cause a lot  of unnecessary **FYI** email traffic.

### Change

Human beings detest change. We work against this force when trying to change the way people interact with the world. We also detest change in workplace. When we encounter or propose a change there are 3 fundamental response types:

* Blindly loyal (asks no questions)
* Believers but Questioners
  * Skeptics (Show me)
  * Passive Observers (What's in it for me?)
  * Opposed (Fear of Change)
  * Opposed (Fear of loss of power)
* Militantly Opposed (will undermine and destroy)

Success depends on the way "Believers but Questioners" are handled.

We think that change is modeled this way:

```
Old Status Quo ---(A better idea)--> New Status Quoa
```

However a more close approximation is:

```
Old Status Quo ---(Foreign Element)---> Chaos --(Transforming Idea)--->
  Practice and Integration ---> New Status Quo
```

Being aware of this model helps us with the changes. One last thing to note about change is that in order for any change to be effective, `failure` should be an option. People should feel safe to make mistakes otherwise risk aversion will prevent any change in its infancy.

### Organizational Learning

There is a difference between Experience and Learning. Definition of learning also includes the incorporation of whatever is the thing one is learning into their lives. At organizational level this means an organization changes its behavior based on the experiences and findings it makes. This is a long subject that we will cover in detail in the Fifth Discipline book.

But a critical question authors point out is **where** it happens in an organization. Since top management is too high to see the day to day things and individual contributors are too busy with the day to day things, the only place there this can happen is middle management. And for this to happen, middle management should be talking to each other.

### Various

* Coding War Games: Where the authors put developers against each other to code a component indicated that people from the same company ended up having similar results. Authors conclude that good engineers are in good companies and mediocre ones are in mediocre companies. A better way of saying this IMO is, an engineering team is successful when it can ensure the good engineers come and stay in it.
* Gilb's Law: Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that it superior to not measuring at all.
* E-factor: Uninterrupted Hours / Body-Present Hours
* Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Systems: Deterministic systems can not self-heal since there is no human being present at the time. Automating all the things is not the right solution. With a process (methodology) one needs to be aware of this and ensures that opportunities to heal an automated system are possible and easy.
* Early Overstaffing: A good way to waste time. In general for most of the projects, at the beginning it's much easier to go with a small number of people.
