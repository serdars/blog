[Talk Like TED](http://www.amazon.com/Talk-Like-TED-Public-Speaking-Secrets/dp/1250041120) a book from [Carmine Gallo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine_Gallo) has a lot of summarization of TED talks for an easy read. But it also has great pointers on preparing a great talk. Here are my raw notes out of this book.

READMORE

There are three foundations of great talks: EMOTIONAL, NOVEL & MEMORABLE.

Aristotle named 3 elements to a persuasive talk in [On Rhetoric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion).

* Ethos: Perceived authority of the presenter.
* Pathos: Appealing to emotions.
* Logos: Logic, data supporting the point.

### EMOTIONAL

* Unleash the Master within
  * What is the meaningful connection between you, yourself, and your story?
  * What are you passionate about?
  * What makes your heart sing?
  * What is your Personal Vision?
* Master the Art of Storytelling
  * Stories need to reach heart and mind.
  * Connect at emotional level before getting started.
  * Types of stories one can include in a presentation:
    * Personal: Most effective. Display of vulnerability. No ego included.
    * Stories of Others: Similar without the personal connection.
    * Brands / Corporations / ...: Same form of identity.
  * Avoid buzzwords & cliches
    * Develop a list of words to avoid.
  * Use heroes & villains
  * Any persons life when told in a humble, rich and non-egotic way is a great story.
* Have a Conversation
  * Practice, practice & practice.
  * Deliver it as if you are having a natural conversation.
  * Get help with planning.
  * Early feedback (record yourself and watch it if no other feedback type exists)
  * Develop your presentation from whole to pieces.
  * Conversational Tone:
    * Find your optimum combination of: Rate / Volume / Pitch / Pause
    * Great leaders and communicators have an air of confidence (ethos)
    * Using gestures frees up some mental capabilities for the listeners.
    * Use gestures in key moments.
    * Keep gestures in the power sphere: Eye level plus and minus amr length.
  * Easy fixes:
    * Standing rigidly: Walk around the room.
    * Fidgeting / Tapping: Move with a purpose.

### NOVEL

* Teach me something new
  * Human brain loves to learn new things.
  * Make ire relevant and easy to understand.
    * Link it to daily life.
  * Aim to leave with "Hey I learnt something" feeling.
    * (It is also a thing to watch out for since this feeling can trick one into thinking they are an expert on a topic)
  * Have a twitter friendly headline.
    * What is the one thing people need to know?
* Deliver Jaw-Dropping Moments
  * Bill Gates releasing mosquitos.
  * They create "emotionally charged event" which brains can remember more easily.
  * Unexpected / shocking statistics.
  * Creative Messaging (iPhone announcement made subtly with an iPad, a phone and an internet device...)
  * Image & Video
  * Memorable Headlines
  * Always end in a high note.
* Lighten Up
  * Brain loves humor.
  * How to be funny without being funny?
    * Anecdotes, observation & personal stories
    * Analogies, metaphors, quotes
    * Videos, photos

### MEMORABLE

* 18 minute rule
  * Anything longer should be broken down into a soft break every 10 minutes.
  * Don't let the cognitive backlog grow.
    * Listening is draining.
  * Human mind can understate / store 3 pieces of information at the same time.
  * Human mind can "keep in mind" 7 plus & minus 2 things.
  * Step by Step:
    * Twitter friendly headline
    * 3 key messages
    * 3 supporting stories, statistics
* Paint a mental picture with multisensory experiences
  * Deliver presentations that touch: sight, sound, taste, smell, touch.
  * When possible show a picture rather than words.
  * When possible show the thing rather than its picture (demo)
* Stay in your lane
  * Be authentic, open, transparent.
  * Spotting phonies are easy (System 2 does this constantly).
  * Trying to be something other than you are, and you will lose the confidence and trust (ethos) of the audience really fast.
