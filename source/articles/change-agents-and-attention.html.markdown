We human beings, are change agents. We can not live without a change. Our senses only work when there is a change. We can't interpret the world if there was no change. Imagine the image you're seeing right now, hears you're hearing just stops. It's easy to image for image but tough for the other senses. Thankfully change is abundant in the world.

However change is only abundant in the world in small scale. Daily routines, work, kids pretty frequently turn life into a unchanging blob of fast flowing time which we detest. As a reflex what do we do; we go after small scale changes. There are many many types of small changes we go after. These small changes basically keep us busy. We feel as if we're doing something in fact we're just idling ourselves.

Some are pretty straightforward. They are things we shouldn't do. TV staring for e.g. watching the Friends episode you've already watched or maybe one of the reality shows. Food is another common one. More complicated one would be reading a book for example. Are you reading that book to keep yourself busy? In the plane it's very hard to just sit down on our seats. We got to do something. Who doesn't carry more than needed books / games / laptops / readers to a travel?

Even work can fall into this category. For $reasons, we tell ourselves well I'll just send these emails right now. Smoking, drugs, etc... are the consumable versions. They require further changes like increasing the dose and what not.

We spend our attention on these things without benefits. And we come up with more and more complex things. Checking Facebook for example. Do we really need to spend that much time on Facebook? BTW note that Facebook would turn into a boring site real quick if it weren't able to change so quickly. New features, apps, etc...

One common thing to note here is that most of these distractions we're putting ourselves into require some sort of money form us. A more subtle business model here is the advertisement based internet where Facebook is free but there are some businesses out there who are willing to pay for our attention. They are willing to pay facebook for the opportunity to offer a "suggestion" for the distractin we're looking.

I'm not suggesting that these are all bad no no things. Checking Facebook is definitely fun, reading books can be definitely productive. Even watching the friends episode you've seen 100 times is needed sometimes when you just want to idle. No car / motor can work for 100% of the time.

But we shouldn't forget our attention is really valuable. When we spend it without getting anything we're just wasting it.

```
People looking for a distraction => Companies paying to offer a suggestion "a.k.a. impression" => Search is more valuable because your level of intent is higher => facebook changes fast to keep your attention

What does "taste" mean in this context? You want change but you don't want too much change. Only in the context of a subset. BTW food taste has some social connotations
```
-------------------
If I was to stop doing a single thing I would want to stop doing too much idling. What I mean by idling is doing something without having an intent just to distract myself from the dissatisfactions in life.

Let me give a few examples. Food is a big example for me. Concentrating on the tastes that I'm feeling and getting the satisfaction of both the good tastes and also the feeling of getting full makes me forget the dissatisfaction that I'm in. Reading is a similar example. I found myself yesterday reading about the origin of languages; random blog posts. Twitter / Facebook / ... is definitely a strong one.
