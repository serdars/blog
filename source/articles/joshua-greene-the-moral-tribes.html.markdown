### Does science deliver the moral truth?

Scientific Theory of Morality: *Morality is a set of psyhological adaptations that allow otherwise selfish individuals to reap the benefits of cooperation*

The problem of `evolved to`. Cooperations is not the end goal. Therefore it's not "the" moral truth.

**Naturalistic Fallacy** To identify that which is natural with that which is right || good.

Evolutionary approach suggests this moral axiom: *What's right is what best fulfills the purpose for which morality is evolved.* Note that this is not necessarily that which spreads our genes.

Mr Greene takes an agnostic approach on The Moral Truth however wants morality to be *objectively improved by a scientific understanding*. I.e. doesn't care about the existance of the moral truth however suggests taking a pragmatic approach of "optimize for experience (happiness)".

## Common Currency Found

* If all else is equal, we prefer more happieness to less happiness.
* If all else is equal, we prefer to increase the total amount of happiness across the people (taking into account both the number of people and amount of happiness).

*Utilitarianism is the native philosophy of the human manual mode. All objections are driven by automatic settings.*

Human brain model as a general purposes action planner: Consequences, actions, beliefs about the current state of the world and general beliefs about how the world works (casual relationships between actions and consequences). It's not inherently utilitarian. It's utilitarian because it's defined as the optimizing methodology because it's what evolution seems to be doing from the outside. (Note that it might be doing something else)

Optimizing: First for whom? Second what?

For whom? Impartiality. Not because of a moral truth but because it's the best way. Say 10 person is trying to divide 100 coins amongst themselves. If everyone says fairness, then no fight. *However this might change from culture to culture.*

=> **This is also the selflessness of utilitarianism** Mr Greene ties this to empathy with guess, golden rule however doesn't know the why of it.
