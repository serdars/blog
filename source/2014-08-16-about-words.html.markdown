As I was walking yesterday, I shared my path with a lady from a far-eastern country. During the 5 minutes we have walked with a reasonable distance between us, she was on the phone in her own language. I didn't know her language at all but I was able to pick up when she was asking a question, when she was excited or angry.

A combination of sounds that did not make any sense to me at all; were very meaningful and useful for her. The opposite was true as well of course. My beloved words was meaningless combination of letters to anyone who did not speak my language. That was the time I've realized that I was being blind-sighted with the illusion of words.

If you check the [dictionary](http://www.seslisozluk.com), corresponding turkish word for **love** is **ask**. But are they really the same thing? What about **sevda**, which is another turkish word for love? What does a turkish person mean when he utters the word "love"? What does it mean to an american? Does the word *love* really have a global; or forget global national or maybe even personal meaning?

## Frame

As with any topic you can think of; words (associated with that language) has been a topic of conversation amongst human beings for a very long time. For a discussion around the literature internet points us to a lot of resources. For my selfish purposes, I will cherry pick the concepts to set the ground for the discussion ahead:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language
Representation medium for words are varied. Letters, Graphics, spoken language, sign language, tactile (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) even whistled.
Families of languages: The languages that are most spoken in the world today belong to the Indo-European family, which include English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and many others; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Amharic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, Zulu, Shona, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, Malagasy, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific.

* **The Birth of Words**  
  * Common concepts dating to very very early dates.
  * First words probably Emotions & Exclamations expressed in form of gestures / shouts
  * Probably served very primitive purposes: hunting, raising offspring, mating
  * Purposes that involve at least two human beings
  * With the arrival of language it got more easy to agree on representations of common things
    * Morpheme: -ness, -ed, etc...
  * As more common things are agreed upon, the more complex the language got
  * Positive feedback loop benefited humans greatly.
  * Each culture developed their own vocabulary since they were not in touch with many other cultures.
  * With the arrival of writing it got even more easy.
  * Cultures formed institutions to define official meanings of words.
  * Cultures than started exchanging words.
* **Differences**
  * Sociolinguistics
  * Bon Appetit - Afiyet olsun example.
  * Orhan Pamuk huzun example.
  * <<Other Turkish examples>>

  * Sign of the existence of certain concepts common to us all. Called universals.
  * Organically evolved as a consequence of human interactions.
  * Types

      * Sign that different cultures experience certain emotions more than others
      * Also sign that there are probably different types of single emotion.
        * Happiness from philantrophy is different than the one from achievement.
* **Intrigueing Title Here**
  * Existing, being as a special word here...
    * Things doesn't exist by themselves. There is always the opposite.
    * Being a heap or not. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_the_heap
  * Meaning
    * There is no such thing.
    * The words didn't exist by themselves so they can not innately have meanings.
  * Translation is an approximation.
  * Grammar is codification of practices that are constantly in flux.
  * In the end vocabulary is restrictive.
    * There are things that couldn't be described with words. That's why we have poems, novels, ...
* **Practicality**
  * Communicating
    * Not the person you want to talk to.
    * Producing / Consuming: Offline version of communication.
    * Has sub goals that we need to be aware of.
    * <<<<<<<<< Example of "What is XXXX" needs attention
    * <<<<<<<<< Any other examples like from Facebook, or whatever?
    * Be aware of the goals. Either yours, or the others.
  * The voice in our head
    * We all have one.
    * It speaks words.
    * I believe replays the sign language or braille for one who doesn't know the sound.
    * Problematic when we talk with it too much.
    * Sometimes it is OK not to be able to rationalize our lives, thoughts, feelings with words in our heads.
