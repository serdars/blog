I believe my teacher in Still Forest Pool. The only way to solve your problems, the single unfailing way is to just look in yourself. When I say I believe this, I don't mean believing as in taking this as a dogma; or having a really strong wish that it is true. I believe in the way I learnt from my teacher. I believe it as if I'm really, really confident about it.

Saying it is much easier than actually doing it. Most of the time we do it autonomously. It's much easier to assume that the problem is caused by something external. Nowadays my job is more demanding than usual, therefore I reserve the right to get "angrier" with you when you get angry with me on a topic that we disagree. It's not my fault. It's beacuse of my job.

Vicky, Christina, Vicky's distant relative... They all face dissatisfactions in their lives and they attempt to fix them by looking for the external causes. Movie expertly shows the first event that will happen on this path. Afer the dissatisfaction is spotted, comes the question of certainty. Do you really "believe" that fixing this dissatisfaction by doing X will be the best thing for you in the long term.

The Painter and The Painteress are the people who walk on this path by answering this question with a simple answer "Yes". Movie paints a great picture of dissatisfaction. Even more awesome it offers some suggestions. I'm calling suggestions but it also might be called solutions, showing eventualities or maybe even utopias.

Even The Painter and The Painteress, two souls that are made of each other can't make it. An utopic picture is presented when Christina joins them. The Painteress captures the eventuality of Christina with the minimum number of words "chronic dissatisfaction" which thanks to cause-effect chain breaks the utopia. Lucky Vicky gets to make a simulation of what would happen if she answered the courage question with yes or no.

Great sights from Barcelona, Penelope Cruz and The Painter's acting performance, real people and real events made the movie a definite re-run for me. I envied how accurately and effortlessly The Painter was able to capture the reality in his conversations and how the movie shows the reality without suggesting or offering grandiose solutions.

I can't wait to see Barcelona.
