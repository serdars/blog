## Laws of the Fifth Discipline

1. Today's problems come from yesterday's solutions: Today's problems are often caused by the partial solutions we have done to yesterday's problems.
1. The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back: One of our instincts to try a solution harder when it is not enough to fix a problem. Government's bail out program by its own doesn't solve the fundamental problem. It only makes them need more bail outs.
1. Behavior grows better before it grows worse: After a partial solution you will see the situation improving slightly before it gets worse. Slight improvement is only temporary symptomatic fix before the underlying cause kicks in again, in a more strong way.
1. The easy way out usually leads back in: To feel comfortable, we most of the time apply familiar solutions to the problems we face rather than looking for the real root cause and dealing with it.
1. The cure can be worse than the disease: Most of the times, symptomatic solutions strengthen the underlying cause or create even bigger problems.
1. Faster is slower: Fastest way is the most commonly requested way in today's world. But it is not necessarily the best way. Optimal rate is most of the time not the fastest way.
1. Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space: Most of the time effects of our actions are visible sometime in the future and when that time comes we forget the action we have done in the past to see the connection.
1. Small changes can produce big results - but the areas of highest leverage are often least obvious.
1. You can have your cake and eat it too - but not at once: Sometimes dilemmas present themselves as problems but they are an artifact of **snapshot thinking rather than process thinking**. E.g. increasing the quality and decreasing the costs is not achievable when you think in terms of snapshots. Investing in training and testing can increase the quality and the costs. But overtime when the effects of these changes kick in, costs will be decreased due to reduced re-work, low level of defects, etc...
1. Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants: Dividing a big problem into two most of the time doesn't produce two smaller problems. It changes the nature of the original problem and makes it impossible to track the root cause.
1. There is no blame: When there is blame, there is "us" vs "them". Systems thinking requires to think ourselves and external entities as parts of a single system.

## A Shift of Mind

We live in an extremely complex world which is getting more and more complex every day. There are few reasons that prevents us to analyze and understand the systems we live in:

* Separating the parts from the whole. Analyzing them and expecting to combine our analysis to explain to whole.
* Letting go of responsibility saying "It is the way system is" or "System is too complex for me".

Most of the time we think in a linear way:

`Terrorist Attacks -> Threat to Americans -> Need to respond militarily`

And we see only part of the problem. We miss the part of:

`US Military Activity -> Perceived aggressiveness of US -> Terrorist Recruits -> Terrorist Attacks`

Linear thinking only deals with the variables at hand. It deals with **detail complexity**. There is a second type of complexity, **dynamic complexity**, where cause and effect are subtle and distributed over time. Real leverage most of the time lies in understanding the dynamic complexity.

Systems Thinking gives us a framework in order to be able to understand and analyze the system as a whole. It enables us to:

* See interrelationships rather than linear cause-effect chains
* See processes of change rather than snapshots.

It starts with **feedback** concept and aims to recognize the types of structures or **patterns** that occur again and again. It builds up a language with vocabulary that makes it easy to talk about systems and their composition.

## Words of the Language

Systems are made up of circles but we see them as straight lines. Circles are simple ways to represent feedback inside a system. For e.g.:

![Example](2014-12-18-peter-m-senge-the-fifth-discipline-part-2/basic.png)

In the systems perspective, the human actor is part of the feedback process, not standing apart from it. This view shifts the way we are seeing our selves. Everyone shares the responsibility of the behaviors of the system, benefits as well as problems.

There are two distinct types of feedback loops:

* **Reinforcing** (positive, amplifying) Non-Stable, Asymptotical Growth
* **Balancing** (stabilizing) Stable

Many feedback processes also contain **delays**. The way to think about delays is to insert "things will happen eventually" on the influence line. Delays most of the time cause fluctuations before reaching the stable point.

In the nature, prety much all of the reinforcing processes have a counteracting balancing process. Balancing processes are said to have their own agendas or goals. However the stabilizing point of the process is not directly determined by the goals of the individual actors in it.

## Sentences of the Language

Sentences also called **System Archetypes** are the common patterns that can be detected in the world. They are simple in their nature but we can see them all around us.

### Limits to Growth

A reinforcing process is set in motion to produce a desired result. After creating a spiral of success it creates inadvertant side effects which manifests as a balancing process and limits the growth.

**Management Principle:** Don't push growth. Remove the factors limiting growth.

![Example](2014-12-18-peter-m-senge-the-fifth-discipline-part-2/limits-to-growth.png)

**Pattern of Behavior:** In this process, limit gradually becomes more powerful. Eventually growth can slow and reinforcing process can start turning it back. You can see minor fluctuations if there are some solution attempts.

**Leverage:** In these situations, instinctive behavior is to try to push harder. But the leverage is in the balancing loop. To change the behavior of the system identify and change or **influence** the limiting factor.

### Shifting the Burden

An underlying problem generates symptoms that demand attention. But the underlying problem is difficult to discover or address (costly, cultural blocks, etc...) so people shift the burden to other solutions. Well intentioned but can only cure the symptoms temporarily. As underlying problem grows worse, and it mostly does, the impact will be felt.

**Management Principle:** Beware symptomatic solution. Only use it to remediate the pain if it is inevitable.

![Example](2014-12-18-peter-m-senge-the-fifth-discipline-part-2/shifting-the-burden.png)

**Pattern of Behavior:** The best example is alcoholism. The size of the symptomatic response will grow over time as the underlying cause gets worse and worse.

**Leverage:** Leverage is in strengthening the fundamental response and weakening the symptomatic response. Communicating the symptomatic responses and fundamental responses help. Fundamental responses require long term orientation and shared vision. Symptomatic responses are needed only if the situation is dire and should be used temporarily.

## Paragraphs of the Language

One can form paragraphs using these sentences now. An example is a Company who creates a reinforcing process by utilizing a novel technology and achieves growth and faces a balancing process when it runs out of manufacturing capacity. They slowly erode their goals in delivery time which leads to frustrated customers and lower the sales numbers. However since the delivery time erosion is gradual (boiling frog syndrome) they don't realize it. They only see the decreased sales numbers and push more marketing strategies to increase them back up. Symptomatic solutions do not provide fixes to the underlying fundamental problem.

This is actually another systems archetype called **Growth and Underinvestment**. One would question how generalizable these archetypes are. But the important bit is that using the concepts as the language, our situation can be defined and talked about.  Without systems thinking it is hard to argue that the fundamental issue is the frustration about the delivery time.

It is hard to argue with the principle of leverage. We all know the metaphor of not being able to see the forest for the trees. Unfortunately when we step back sometimes we still don't see the forest, we only see trees. Systems thinking provides us the language to be able to see the forest and the trees at the same time.
