Sometimes we make a big deal out of beginnings. We put together detailed plans for them, prepare ourselves to bravely execute and expect to feel differently after the moment they occur. After all we are not the same person after beginning that thing. The world is a different place now. Or is it?

Sometimes we are scared of them. We need to think it through and convince ourselves that it is OK to begin. What if that happens? What if it doesn't go well? What would other people think now that I am doing this? Maybe we are scared of ourselves and how will the beginnings impact ourselves. Most of the time we don't begin because of this. Sometimes we trick ourselves into believing that we will begin sometime soon. We research, draft, talk to people, write documents, obsess about them. But we never begin. We get the pleasure of doing that thing without investing the required effort by imagining ourselves beginning it.

Things get a lot easier when we don't make a big deal out of beginnings. We see ourselves as unchanging entities and we see beginnings as times when we make a conscious decision to change ourselves. This creates the sense that beginnings are important. They are not. We are not black or white. Our color is always gray with a shade that is constantly changing over time. Beginnings are the small shifts that we intentionally make in our shade. Nothing more.

There was a TED talk (which I'm not able to find anymore) talking about how our happiness is affected by the way we're trying to achieve our goals. One way is to set a goal for yourself, e.g. being CEO; and do anything and everything to achieve that goal. Another way is to treat your goal as an aspiration and set yourself smaller goals that will get you closer to your aspiration.

According to the talk second way makes you happier. I think there are two benefits to the second path.

1. You don't need to make sure that your goal is the right one. You can begin your road tomorrow.
2. After you begin, you discover what the road looks like and decide if that goal is really the one that you want to achieve.

Say you aspire to write a novel. You first google "How to write a novel". You order two books from you know where and read them. You brainstorm to find an idea worthy of being a novel. You prepare a few character sheets and draft a storyline. Then you worry about miserably failing and google "How to get published". You start learning about the tricks that makes a novel readable. You start thinking about if these tricks are inline with your philosophy of writing. Then you go back to your draft storyline. You don't like it. Suddenly other things start creeping in your life and you don't have any time to write your novel anymore. A beginning whose expiration date has just passed.

Using the second way, you can begin tomorrow by writing a story and having your friends read it. Then you can write a longer story and see sacrifices writing a novel require you to do. Maybe you can write a short draft and get it to a few people in the industry and see what they think. Maybe you will discover that writing a novel is your over-romanticised dream, short stories are your true passion. Maybe after writing a few of them it gets boring you like writing about real things. You change direction again. Who knows, maybe you'll discover that drinking better beer is the most important thing in life while writing a story about a Beer Festival.

Many ideas are based on not making a big deal out of *beginning**s. Lean startup, waterfall vs agile, prototyping instead of writing a document... Planning to start a diet next Monday; start right now by not eating that bag of chips. Planning to start an exercise program, start right now by taking a 15 minutes run. Planning to start spending more time with your family, pick up the phone and call them right now.

Whatever it is that you are planning to begin, begin tomorrow by taking the first brave step. You will be one step closer to your destination.

Says one who has been planning to start a blog for the last few years :)
