Sometimes we make a bigger than needed deal out of them. We plan for them, prepare bravely execute and expect to feel differently after the moment they occur. After all we are not the same person anymore because we've begun something. The world is a different place now thanks to the thing that just began.

Sometimes we are scared of them. We need to think it through and convince ourselves that it is OK to begin. Because of this most of time we don't begin. World is full of ghost ideas, effects not linked to any causes, wishes and regrets.

Sometimes we trick ourselves into believing that we will begin sometime soon. We just want to get the pleasure of beginning without investing the required effort to begin and without needing to worry about or deal with the consequences. We believe that we are really about to begin and we talk about it. We get the initial kick of beginnings, feel their excitement followed by the sinking feeling of statusquo.

Things get a lot easier when we don't make a big deal out of beginnings. We are not discrete state machines that switch their states based on an event or with an inherent decision. In other words, we are not black or white. Our color is always gray, whose shade is constantly changing over time.

There was a TED talk (which is now removed unfortunately) which talks about approaching and measuring our progress against our goals directionally rather than discretely. Rather than setting up a big goal for ourselves and tearing apart other things in life to achieve that, we should set smaller goals in the direction of a bigger aspiration in mind. The line between your aspiration and you is not a straight one:

This helps with a couple of things. Firstly we are not stuck in analysis paralysis and we can **"begin"** tomorrow. Secondly most of the time we discover new things on the way to our big aspiration which ends up changing our aspiration.

Say you aspire to write a novel. Reading tens of "how to write a novel", "how to get published" books, preparing character sheets, trying out writer software to select the one that's right for you, discussing many ideas with your friends  before **beginning** to write a novel is going to be less useful than writing a short story on a piece of paper. After all you don't know what writing a novel demands from you. You don't know if your aspiration is your true passion or a romanticised self fulfilling dream. The line between your aspiration and you may very well be like this:

Many ideas are based on not making a big deal out of *beginning**s. Lean businesses, fail early fail fast mentality, Kanban, prototyping instead of writing a design document... Whatever it is that you are planning to begin, begin tomorrow by taking the first brave step.

Planning to start a diet next Monday, start right now by not eating that bag of chips. Planning to start an exercise program, start right now by taking a 15 minutes walk. Planning to start spending more time with your family, pick up the phone and call them right now.

Say one who has been planning to start a blog last few years.
