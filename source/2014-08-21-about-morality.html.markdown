What does the "morality" feel like? How does one feel the real time impact of it on oneself? Is it a feeling mixed with fear of some bad consequence will come to oneself because of doing something? Or is it a feeling that society will not approve of the thing you're about to do and not doing it?

How does it align with the levels of morality in the buddhism where 1-) You do something because someone hits you with a stick otherwise. 2-) You do something because you hit yourself with a stick otherwise. 3-) You pick the right thing to do by yourself for yourself.

I think I might have felt how number 3 feels. It is almost like a feeling of fear or jealousy. It is independent of oneself. It is a kind of subtle restlessnes that you know that doing that thing is not right even tough you can't exactly tell why. It is just like other feelings which start, develop and eventually die.

Aligning it with the moral machinery in System 1 that Joshua Greene was talking about, maybe mindfulness develops the primitive moral center we have in our brains. That center becomes a sophisticated center that not only does detect and signal the violence but it also prompts you when doing other things that it knows is not skillful.

Just like other feelings it doesn't have any reward in the end. We intuitively expect something good to happen to us when we be moral. Even tough we understand that it doesn't necessarily happen with our minds, we still feel that feeling of expectancy and the corresponding disappointment. But morailty just as another feeling (or another thread in our minds) doesn't give any rewards back.

Speaking of threads vs feelings vs emotions; I need to research perception vs emotions vs feelings vs threads.
